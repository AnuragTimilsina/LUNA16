# The LUNA-16 Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through the typical workflow that you will be using to build a model for the LUNA 16 challenge.
This is the first of several tutorials. While I have tried to make the whole process as simple as I can, I have decided to maintain the iterative approach that is inherent to data science.
Data science is, by nature, very iterative. 

## Context and TOC

Broadly speaking, this tutorial will follow the iterative approach found in many data science projects. At a high level, this tutorial aims at:

1. Acquiring the data successfully.
2. Explore the files downloaded.
3. Explore the contents of the RAW data .
4. Explore the metadata downloaded.
5. Experiment with fitting different models to achieve the desired goal.

The Jupyter notebooks provided in this repository are listed in the order you will face as a data scientist. Each file represents a single task, and I recommend you follow these notebooks in order.
