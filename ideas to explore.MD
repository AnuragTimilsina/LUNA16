Scratchpad of some ideas to consider:

- [ ] When loading data, do I really need to load this in an ```np.float32``` or can i use a ```np.float16``` instead?
- [ ] For 3D visualization, find out if there's a way for the axes not to be squared
- [ ] Build the offline analysis library
- [ ] Ensure that the 3D projection axes are correct
- [ ] Add labels to the 3D projection
